# ProfessionalResume
HTML and CSS were used to create a professional experience website.  This website includes a short biography section, a section including previously completed projects, a link to the resume and a section with contact information with links to the user's email, linkedin, and github page.  

Styling and structure of the webpage have been laid out with notation that breaks up the secctions clearly based on content.
